I am elated to tell you all that I have been selected for [Season of KDE](http://season.kde.org). I'll be working on improving [baloo](https://community.kde.org/Baloo). I will be analyzing [xapian](http://xapian.org/) (the currently used search engine library) and try to find a better alternative to it, eventualy implementing it. This will be a great learning opportunity for me. Thanks to KDE for giving me this chance to test my skills. Also a special thanks to my mentor Vishesh Handa. I'll be posting weekly reports here about my project starting this weekend.
